            EPISODE IV<br />
            A NEW MARKETING CAMPAIGN
        </p>

        <p>It is a time of great sadness in the scouting popcorn community.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Evan, the young padawan and Webelos, has been vainly attempting to sell popcorn for his scout troop. He began his campaign as the so-called "King of Popcorn"</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>His father, the Jedi Knight John, developed a web site based on the idea of popcorn as a guilty pleasure taken to the extreme. He even went so far as to associate Evan with seedy, underworld characters such as "Scarface" and Al Capone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While the web site gathered rave reviews, it led to approximately $0 in sales.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Seriously. Not one bag of popcorn moved. We didn't even get donations for the military.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Eventually, John came to the conclusion that vaguely threatening people in order to get them to buy popcorn was - perhaps - a bad idea. Who can tell these days.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Then, Evan's mom said "maybe something with 'Star Wars' in it?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>John was dumbfounded at the simple perfection of the idea. He liked Star Wars. People in general like Star Wars.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Well, maybe not Episode I.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Or Episode II.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Or most of Episode III.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the <i>concept</i> is always great. People overcoming adversity to right a great wrong, defeat a great evil, or sell some popcorn.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>So, please, head on over to <a href="http://trails-end.com/?scout=3d2c05bead2ba43" target="scout" >Trail's End</a> and buy some popcorn before Disney's lawyers get wind of this.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I'm not kidding. One time, they made a small daycare center paint over a picture of Mickey Mouse due to copyright infringement. I can only imagine what they'll do to me...</p>
